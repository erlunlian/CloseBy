CloseBy is a GPS-based messaging app in order to chat with people around you. Currently the app supports creating, joining, and messaging in GPS-based chats. You can explore the chats around you in either a grid view or on the map itself. More features are coming soon.

# How to Use
The app opens to the main map screen. Swipe left to access your chats, and swipe right to see the explore page of all nearby chats. Tapping on a marker on the map screen will open up brief info about the chat, and tapping that info will also allow you to access the chat. The profile and settings buttons are currently non-functional, but are going to be implemented soon. Move the slider to adjust the level of zoom on the map.
